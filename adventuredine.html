          <!--OVERVIEW-->
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>Users need a fun way to explore San Francisco -- whether they’re locals, tourists, or recently relocated there -- by discovering food and drink points of interest brought to life with guides leading you through various adventures.</p>
          <h3>The Project</h3>
          <p>Type: Case Study, Solo Project</p>
          <p>Duration: 5 months</p>
          <p>For this UX Designer program, I developed the concept for an application that would enable users to enjoy scavenger hunts to discover new locations in their own city.</p>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>As the solo designer, I was responsible for the entire development, from: defining business requirements, user research, wireframing and prototyping, polishing and iterating on designs</p>
          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>After assessing current scavenger hunt apps on the market, I noticed several areas of opportunity. The current apps only cater towards a specific action or achievement, and after enough repetition, the app experience is no longer exciting. The other way scavenger hunt apps work is playing on user nostalgia, such as in PokemonGo. These kinds of apps have cult following, but tend to diminish over time. The problem again is the novelty and users getting accustomed to the app.</p>
          <h3>My Approach</h3>
          <p>I wanted to create an app that ties to practical uses and existing behaviors that are exhibited by my target audience of people from their early 20s to late 30s who live in the Bay Area. The challenge became how to create a platform that appeals to users over a period of time, and that can cater to both locals and visitors in various situations, from discovering new restaurants or new bars to new districts to frequent for the best brunch spots.</p>
          <h3>Tools Used</h3>
          <p>Sketch</p>
          <p>InVision</p>
          <p>Usability Hub</p>
          <p>OptimalSort</p>
          <h3>Design Process</h3>
          <p>I applied the double diamond design process to the AdventureDine app. The below process focuses on the inspiration, conceptualization and iteration of the app.</p>

          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>Users need a fun way to explore San Francisco - whether they’re local, tourists, or recently relocated there - by discovering cultural landmarks and points of interest brought to life with guides leading you through various, changing quests.
<br>We know this to be true when we see an increase in user signups and downloads and number of users completing quests, and referring others to play.</p>
          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>What are the current strengths & weaknesses of current scavenger hunt apps on the market? What do users expect from these apps?
            <br>I analyzed Pokemon go and actionbound with these questions in mind. This analysis provided me a framework to assess what I wanted to include in my design and how I might differentiate my app from the existing scavenger hunt apps on the market. The competitor analysis included:
	           Marketing Profile<br>
             SWOT Profile<br>
             UX Analysis<br>
             App Store & Google Play Review<br>
          </p>
          <h3>User Stories</h3>
          <p>For the next step, I developed user stories to identify the user motives and features  they would expect:
            <ul>
              <li>I want to be able to quickly get a sense of what the app is about, so a clear goal and simple home screen and navigation are critical components.</li>
              <li>As a user, I want to create my own tasks that fit my specific needs. I need the app to be flexible to support various kinds of content gathering while providing options to add template options when I run out of ideas.</li></ul>
          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p>To get a better sense of what the user needs, motivations and frustrations were, I conducted interviews with three participants. I was able to analyze their responses using affinity mapping to establish clear patterns.</p>
          <p>I analyzed the feedback into the following six categories:</p>

          </picture>
          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>From these six interviews, I built two personas. These personas were helpful to refer to in the later steps, ensuring that I was addressing their unique needs and goals.</p>

          </picture>
          <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>
          <p>With my personas, I then created user journey maps, to more deeply assess each persona’s unique pain points and motivations while using the app.</p>

          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>I created user flows to determine the flow that my personas would need to to go through to achieve their goals.</p>

          <h3>Site Map</h3>
          <p>To get a better sense of what the user needs, motivations and frustrations were, I conducted interviews with six participants. I was able to analyze their responses using affinity mapping to establish clear patterns. To gain a better understanding of what users might want, I did 5 tree tests with participants from the US, Germany and South Africa. The resulting site map is below.</p>

            </picture>
          <h3>Ideate</h3>
          <p>In this phase, I developed initial screens and later used Sketch to build mid-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes. I determined how to present the main needs of my users:
            <ul>
              <li>A easily searchable list of restaurants and activities</li>
              <li>A way for users to easily create their own itineraries</li>
              <li>A way for users to see nearby restaurant recommendations</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Wireframes</h3>

            <img src="img/project_adventuredine/wireframes1.jpg" alt="Image">
          </picture>
          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>I tested this first iteration of the prototype to assess whether users were able to easily navigate through the app’s functionality. I did 3 remote and 3 moderated testing sessions, for a total of 6 participants.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Task 1. Login to the app</li>
              <li>Task 2. Search for a restaurant</li>
              <li>Task 3. Try the Roulette feature</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Testing Results</h3>
            <p>From these tests, I documented the observations, positive and negative comments, and errors encountered by each participant. I labeled each note for future refernece.</p>

            </picture>
          <h3>Affinity Mapping & Proposing Solutions</h3>
              <p>After entering and organizing my observations, I colored the cells per participant and added the total number of errors, as well as proposed solutions and next steps to improve future iterations of my design.</p>

              </picture>
          <h3>Learnings & Next Steps</h3>
          <p>Throughout this project, I’ve learned that more testing early on and throughout the process leads to more actionable results. Even though it’s more time spent initially, the payoff is greater than the extra time spent testing the concepts and usability on people.</p>
