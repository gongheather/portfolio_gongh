          <!--OVERVIEW-->
          <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>The Project</h3>
              <p>Type: Case Study, Solo Project</p>
              <p>Duration: 1 month</p>
              <p>I designed DuoVocab for CareerFoundry's "UX Fundamentals" course, the first part of their more extensive UX design certificate program. My goal for this project was to design an vocabulary app that is customizable, for use on the go and longer study sessions.</p>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
              <p>As the solo designer, I was responsible for the entire development, from: defining business requirements, user research, wireframing and prototyping, polishing and iterating on designs</p>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>The goal of this project was to design a mobile app that empowers people to learn new vocabulary.</p>
          <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>To survey the existing landscape of vocab apps, I analyzed three study apps: Quizlet, Vocabulary Builder and Word of the Day. This research helped orient me to the existing competition and assess how DuoVocab could be differentiated from the competition.</p>
            <h3>User Interviews and User Persona</h3>
            <p>I interviewed three people to learn about study habits. To ensure that I had a range of perspectives, I interviewed a product manager, tech entrepreneur and a stay-at-home mom. I asked the participants how they learn a new topic, their approach to learning new vocabulary and technologies used, and how they prioritize their weekly schedules for learning new material.</p>
            <p>From these interviews, I created a user persona. Meet Alex, a driven professional and lifelong learner with many personal development goals.</p>

            </picture>
          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>Using Alex as a guide for the app, I created the following user stories:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>As a product manager, my work days are full of meetings. To maximize my limited free time outside of work, I need a simple, structured, enjoyable way to learn a new language.</li>
            <li>As a self-motivated individual and somebody who loves quantifying progress, watching my progrss motivates me to learn more and push myself outside of my comfort zone.</li>
            <li>As a working professional constantly learning on the job with limited time, I need an app that helps me learn new content in bite-sized chunks with repetition to reinforce the words when I don't have much time to study.</li>
            <li>From these user stories, I developed specific user flows to explore how she might achieve her learning goals</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p>For this step, I developed user stories to identify the user motives and features they would expect</p>
          <h3>Prototyping and User Testing</h3>
            <p>Having explored this problem space, practiced interviews, created proto-personas and outlined the tasks and flows necessary to design a positive vocabulary leanring experience, I used these learnings to create wireframes around the key user flows.</p>
            <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>With these wireframes, I created a prototype in Prott and conducted usability testing with four users. Participants were presented with the following four tasks:
              <ol>
                <li>You've been inspired to learn a new language and have downloaded a new app, DuoVocab. Go through the onboarding screens to learn more about the app.</li>
                <li>You're interested in trying out one of the games. Sign up to get access to the games.</li>
                <li>Try one of the games.</li>
                <li>You've been using this app for several weeks. How far have you progressed? Check out the progress tab to see your learning history.</li>
              </ol>
              <br>User issues were rated using the Nielsen Norman 0-4 scale of severity.

              <h3>Updates</h3>
              <p>From the feedback in the tests, I made changes to the prototype. Here are some of the issues and associated updates I made.

          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>Throughout this project, I learned how important it is to start testing and gathering feedback as early as possible. Also, adding too much content on each screen can detract from the original intent, it's better to keep content clear and simple. I learned from my participants that they would rather scroll than tap content. Also, it's important to ensure messaging throughout the app is clear, useful and encouraging.</p>
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>My next steps for this project are creating more learning modes and a progress tracker, then testing the existing features more and improving the Chinese learning English side of the app. Adding more details like uploading words, user settings, and reminders to learn would be the next step. Finally, more usability testing.</p>
